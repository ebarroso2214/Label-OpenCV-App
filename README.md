# Label-OpenCV-App
Made for the purpose of making text dectection in images saved into a txt file to use.


### The Purpose of The App

This application was made with the intention of being used at work for my departments label printer. It reduces the risk of human error when creating labels for phones that will be decommissioned. 

This by no means is perfect and is not meant to be. However, it works just as I meant for it to.

### Requirements

This application will require you to have numpy, OpenCV, pillow, Tesseract-OCR, and pytesseract.

Additionally, this is based for macOS only.
