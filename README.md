# Label-OpenCV-App
Made for the purpose of making text dectection in images saved into a txt file to use.


### The Purpose of The App

This application was made with the intention of being used at work for my departments label printer. It reduces the risk of human error when creating labels for phones that will be decommissioned. 

This by no means is perfect and is not meant to be. However, it works just as I meant for it to.

### Requirements

This application will require you to have numpy, OpenCV, pillow, Tesseract-OCR, and pytesseract.

Orginally was designed to be used with macOS but has now been changed to be used with Windows operating system.

Two branches have been created, 'windows' branch for Windows OS and 'testing' branch for macOS. Please refer to each of these when browsing code for your operating system of choice.

Please be sure to use a high quality camera, the camera I used during testing was a Logitech BRIO PRO X webcam for the best possible quality. 

### Additional Notes

Adjust your camera settings as neccessary. I spent quite a while tweaking the settings for the camera quality to pick up the phone's screen texts as accurately as possible.

Another note, so far, the terminal works best for the output, there are issues with the Tkinter created console currently that I am going to be fixing later on.
